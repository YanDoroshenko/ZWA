\section{Pages}
\subsection{Login}
The first page user sees is the login page. The page consists of the login form and the button, leading to the signup page (in case the user does not have an account yet).

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/login.png}
    \caption{Login page}
\end{figure}
The login form consists of the labelled input fields for the login and password and the button that submits entered credentials when it's clicked. In order to improve user experience, user can log in using just keyboard for the login field is focused immediately after page is loaded and then one can switch to the password field pressing Tab (Shift-Tab to switch back) and submit the form by pressing Enter. After the field loses focus, it is pre-validated against the general rules, applicable to login and password (login should start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters, password should not be shorter than 5 characters) and it is styled according to the validation result. If validation fails, an information message is shown. On form submit all the fields are validated simultaniously.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/loginvalidation.png}
    \caption{Input pre-validation}
\end{figure}
On form submit (in case field pre-validation succeeded) credentials are being checked and if they are correct, the user is redirected to the home page. Otherwise an information message is shown and password field is erased.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\subsection{Signup}

Pre-validation rules are the same for the username and password, name is not validated and pasword confirmation is checked against the password (if the values match). The button in the top-rigth corner leads to the login page.
